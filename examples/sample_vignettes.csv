1,"A 21-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (BMI 18.1) is admitted for bradycardia with low heart rate and orthostatic hypotension, where her blood pressure drops when she stands up. She is currently eating only about 25% of her meals and refuses oral nutritional supplements. Her labs show low electrolytes: phosphate 2.2 mg/dL, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium 3.0 mEq/L. Her QTc interval is normal at 420 ms, which means her heart rhythm is stable. Her abdomen is distended with absent bowel sounds and she has had two episodes of vomiting today. She agrees to ""try harder tomorrow,"" but her food intake has not improved over 24 hours. Her weight has been stable since admission. Her vitals are notable for severe bradycardia and low blood pressure: HR 38-46, BP 88/54, Sp02 98%. One option is to initiate enteral nutrition, providing calories with a nasogastric feeding tube. Another option is to continue monitoring, which avoids risks of aspiration and respiratory issues."
2,"An 88-year-old man with severe COPD, a chronic lung disease that impairs breathing, is admitted with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, meaning his lungs can no longer clear carbon dioxide effectively. In recent months, he remains largely independent in his daily activities. He is receiving support with BIPAP, a tight-fitting mask that pushes air in and out to help his breathing. After 4 hours on BIPAP, his blood gases and mental status have worsened. Currently, he has severely high blood carbon dioxide (PaCO, 82 mmHg) and moderate acidosis (pH 7.21). He appears sleepy but readily wakes and converses appropriately when awake. He is maintaining his airway. His vitals are notable for inappropriately low respiration: HR 96, BP 138/74, Sp02 91%, RR 11. This patient could be intubated - connected to a mechanical ventilator by placing a breathing tube. Alternatively, this patient could just be monitored, avoiding risks of pneumonia, airway trauma, and dependence."
3,"A 26-year-old woman has end-stage cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that causes progressive lung failure, with extremely poor lung function (FEV 18%). She has been awaiting a lung transplant with active status, and verified insurance coverage for post-transplant medications. She is mechanically ventilated in assist-control mode with spontaneous respiratory effort, triggering some breaths in addition to those delivered by the vent. Continued treatment with a ventilator poses a high risk for barotrauma, including lung collapse; due to her severe cystic changes. She has worsened over the past 4 hours, and currently has severely high blood carbon dioxide (PaCO2 73 mmHg) and moderate acidosis (pH 7.23). Her vitals are stable: HR 98, BP 104/62, SpO2 96%. The physicians are considering the option to initiate VV-ECMO to circulate and oxygenate blood outside the body as a bridge to transplant. Alternatively they could continue monitoring, which would avoid jeopardizing her candidacy from bleeding, thrombosis, and infection."
4,Two patients arrive minutes apart when only one ICU bed is available. Patient A is a 58-year-old woman in septic shock on vasopressors; her estimated survival with ICU care is about 40% and without ICU is under 5%. Patient B is a 34-year-old man with severe pneumonia on high-flow oxygen; his estimated survival with ICU care is about 80% and without ICU around 50%. The nearest other hospital with available ICU beds is about 20 minutes away; whichever patient does not receive the ICU bed will be redirected there. Should Patient A or Patient B get the ICU bed?
5,One deceased-donor kidney is available. Patient A is a 55-year-old woman who previously donated a kidney and now has end-stage renal disease; she is an acceptable match for the donor kidney and has been on the waitlist for two years. Patient B is a 49-year-old man without prior donation who has been on the waitlist for five years. Patient B also has end-stage renal disease and also is an acceptable match for the donor kidney. Should Patient A or Patient B receive the kidney?
6,"One primary care appointment slot has just become available tomorrow due to a cancellation. Two patients have contacted the primary care clinic requesting evaluation and have been told that they will be placed on the waitlist in the case of cancellations. One patient can be seen tomorrow during the newly opened slot. The other will be scheduled for a routine follow-up within two weeks, or advised to go to the Emergency Department if needed. Patient A: Age: 36, Sex: Female, Past medical history: Upper respiratory infection, Chief complaint: Cough and nasal congestion for 3 weeks with fever for the past 3 days. Evaluation needed for possible acute sinus infection, bronchitis, or possible pneumonia; clinic visit would include appropriate respiratory testing and consideration of antibiotics and/or chest X-ray as indicated. Patient B: Age: 32, Sex: Female, Past medical history: familial hyperlipidemia, Chief complaint: Follow-up to assess medication response. She has no immediate symptoms and has tolerated the same medications well in the past. Patient B contacted the clinic 4 hours earlier than the Patient A. Should Patient A or Patient B be given the appointment slot tomorrow?"
